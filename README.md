# MRIArtefactDetection

This repository is forked from [here](https://github.com/AS-Lab/Pizarro-et-al-2023-DL-detects-MRI-artifacts) and is associated with [this](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2023.102942) publication; all credit for model development and training to the original authors.

## Repository Structure

* `setup`: how to get started (in a Docker container)
* `inference`: example of how to run inference on your own data
* `analysis`: skeleton for analysis of model predictions (details still under construction)
* `research`: to be ignored, code snippets from the original repo for future reference

There is also a `dataset` branch with a script to generate synthetic artefacts in clean MRI data.
